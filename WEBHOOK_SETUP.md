# üîó Webhook Configuration Setup

The webhook is currently not configured because the required environment variables are missing. Follow these steps to set up your webhooks:

## üìù Step 1: Create Environment File

**Create a `.env.local` file in your project root** (this file should not be committed to git):

```bash
# Create the environment file
touch .env.local
```

Then add the following variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Required: Your Whop App ID (Public)
# Get this from: Whop Dashboard ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí General/Overview
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=app_your_app_id_here

# Required: Your Whop API Key (Secret)
# Get this from: Whop Dashboard ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí API Keys
WHOP_API_KEY=whop_live_your_api_key_here

# Required: Your Whop User ID (Public)
# Get this from: Whop Dashboard ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí User ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID=user_your_user_id_here

# Required: Your Company ID (Public)
# Get this from: Whop Dashboard ‚Üí Company ‚Üí Overview
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID=company_your_company_id_here

# Required: Webhook Secret for validating webhooks
# Get this from: Whop Dashboard ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Webhooks
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# Required: Your app's public URL (for webhook configuration)
# For development with ngrok: https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
# For production: https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app-url.ngrok.io
```

## üîë Step 2: Get Your Credentials from Whop Dashboard

### 1. App ID (`NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID`)
- Go to [Whop Dashboard](https://dashboard.whop.com)
- Navigate to **Apps** ‚Üí **Your App**
- Look for **App ID** in the General/Overview section
- Format: `app_1234567890abcdef`

### 2. API Key (`WHOP_API_KEY`)
- In your app settings, go to **API Keys** tab
- Create a new API key or copy existing one
- Format: `whop_live_1234567890abcdef...`

### 3. Agent User ID (`NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID`)
- Go to your **Profile** in Whop Dashboard
- Find your **User ID** in profile settings or URL
- Format: `user_1234567890abcdef`

### 4. Company ID (`NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID`)
- Go to **Company** settings in Whop Dashboard
- Find **Company ID** in the overview section
- Format: `company_1234567890abcdef`

### 5. Webhook Secret (`WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
- In your app settings, go to **Webhooks** tab
- Create a new webhook or copy existing secret
- Format: `whsec_1234567890abcdef...`

### 6. App URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`)
- This is your app's public URL that Whop will use to send webhooks
- For development: Use ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
- For production: Use your domain (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

## üåê Step 3: Configure Webhook URL

### For Development (using ngrok):
1. Install ngrok: `brew install ngrok` (macOS) or download from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)
2. Start your app: `npm run dev`
3. In another terminal, run: `ngrok http 3000`
4. Copy the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
5. In Whop Dashboard ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Webhooks, set the URL to: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks`

### For Production:
Set the webhook URL to: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks`

## üìã Step 4: Enable Webhook Events

In your Whop app's webhook settings, enable these events:

### Available Events (from actual Whop apps):
- `chat.message_sent` - User sends a chat message
- `chat.message_replied` - User replies to a chat message  
- `chat.discussion_started` - User starts a new discussion
- `chat.reaction_received` - User receives a reaction on their message

**Note:** These events come from Whop's standard apps (Chat, Forum, Course, Events, Livestreaming). Make sure these apps are installed in your Whop community first.

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Verify Setup

1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Check the console for any environment variable errors
3. Test webhook by sending a chat message in your Whop community
4. Check your app logs for webhook events

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Environment variables not configured" error:
- ‚úÖ Make sure `.env.local` file exists in project root
- ‚úÖ Verify all required variables are set (no "your_*_here" placeholders)
- ‚úÖ Include NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL in your .env.local file
- ‚úÖ Restart your development server after adding variables

### Webhook not receiving events:
- ‚úÖ Check that webhook URL is accessible from internet
- ‚úÖ Verify webhook secret matches between Whop and your app
- ‚úÖ Ensure required webhook events are enabled
- ‚úÖ Check webhook URL format: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks`

### API errors:
